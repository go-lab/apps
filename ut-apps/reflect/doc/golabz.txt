Chempy is a tool specifically designed to enter and check chemical formula
using the standard notation of using subscripts for coefficients and
superscripts for charges.  Teachers configure Chempy by giving the formula
(e.g., Na+ + Cl- -> NaCl) that students have to enter.  Inside an ILS Chempy
checks whether the student has entered the correct formula.  Students can
enter coefficients and charges using the _ and ^ keys which Chempy will display
as sub- and superscripts respectively.

Description.

The Reflection Tool gives feedback to students about their use of an Inquiry
learning Space (ILS).  The tool displays the percentage of time a student has
spent in the various inquiry phases compared to a percentage norm set by the
teacher (see image).  Students are prompted to reflect on their ILS use by a
number of questions teachers can enter during configuration.

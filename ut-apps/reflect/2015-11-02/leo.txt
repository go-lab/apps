    English language inquiry phase labels are appearing alongside with
    Estonian labels (see screenshot1)

    The loading time of this version seems slower when compared to the
    original reflection tool app

    I do not completely see the scroll bars on the right hand side of the app
    when my browser zoom size is above 30% (see screenshot2)

    In the configuration editor the Norms can take on unrealistic values (see
    screenshot3)

    In the configuration editor there is a Help section option but this is not
    seen when I enter the Show standalone view

    In the configuration editor it would be beneficial to customize whether or
    not to show the time spent in the Discussion phase. The Discussion phase
    is often the last step and therefore students do not need to reflect on
    the time they spent in this inquiry phase.

    The saving functionality is still not working properly. When I logoff and
    login with my nickname the prior text I wrote was not saved.

    A running calculation of time spent in the phases is not available
    (i.e. when I logoff and login with my nickname the total time spent
    considering prior sessions is not updated but rather the calculation
    starts all over again).
